Loader of SISS-Geo images

   The dataset of SISS-Geo images is organized as follows:

       sissgeo
       ├── test
       │   └── 1276-2-1.jpg
       └── train
           ├── 1234-7-1.jpg
           ├── 1234-7-2.jpg
           └── 1235-3-1.jpg

   Each SISS-Geo image obeys the pattern <id>-<class>-<n>.jpg, where 'id' is the
   register identification number, 'class' is the class index (animal type) and
   'n' the n-th image of the register.
